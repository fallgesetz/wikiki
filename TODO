Short Term:

-make append modify edit all be in the same group.
-ability to copy and paste images (with the help of libmagic)

Long Term:

-move shit to .wikiki
-make it possible to do rudimentary version control from the command line (like, repeatedly run git commit inside .wikiki))
-python-magic + libmagic dependency is sort of nasty -- maybe there's an ok way to implement crap from here: http://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html
